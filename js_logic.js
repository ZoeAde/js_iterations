//Prices (use while loops here)
/*Users can see the sum of all prices
Users can see the number of prices that are selected (the count)
Users can see the sum of the selected prices
Users can see the average of all of the prices*/

/*
Hints for the first problem:
  1. Define a function that:
    - is assigned to a variable named `sum`
    - has one parameter named `options`
    - returns the calculated sum of all of the values of all of the options passed in
NOTE: use a `for` loop to make this happen.
*/

function sum (options) {
  for (var i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {
    total = i+=
    }
    return total;
  };










//Rewrite all functions in js/logic.js to not use any for or while loops.
